			<h1>Working for Ripley</h1>
			<p>
				I never thought I'd find myself cleaning the severed head of a serial killer but then I realized that college was expensive and my employment options were limited.  Had I know when I took my job at the museum that, for $7.25 an hour, I would be expected to deal with violent drunks and crying children both regularly wetting their pants in the museum I might have turned it down. Had I known that I was required to get this up close and personal to Peter Kurten I most definitely would have turned it down. I knew he was harmless; he hadn't murdered or brutally sexually assaulted anyone in over 85 years. But as his head slowly rotated in its plexiglass case I came to the conclusion that I hated the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum. Every child who left greasy fingerprints on the two-headed sheep, every drunk who tried to pry out the gravestones on the second floor balcony, every teenager who tried to make out after hours in the iron maiden. I hated the fact that, at that moment, the late, not-so-great Vampire of Dusseldorf's head was slowly rocking back and forth in time with my vigorous scrubbing. I hated that it was midnight and I was alone in a museum of dead people and supposedly haunted artifacts.  But most of all I hated that I was so exhausted and jaded from dealing with tourists that I was no longer scared or fascinated by anything in the museum.  Some of the employees swore up and down that there were ghosts in the museum.  I was too tired to care one way or the other and any ghosts who might have set out to haunt me probably picked up on that. It's true, I never thought I would be cleaning the severed head of a serial killer. But I definitely never thought that I could be bored while doing it. Yet when I look back at that experience I don't think about the severed heads or giant bugs. All I remember is the soul killing monotony and Peter's stupid suspended head.
